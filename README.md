# Chip-8 Emulator

An emulator for the [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) virtual machine proposed by Joseph Weisbecker and first used in the mid-1970s.

I am using this [tutorial](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).

Usage: `./chip8-emu <chip8 application file>`

Example: `./chip8-emu games/invaders.c8`
